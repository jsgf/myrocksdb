RocksDB
=======

This is a high-level binding to RocksDB. The intent is to provide a
safe, efficient, complete and ergonomic binding to RocksDB's API. It
is based on RocksDB's C binding, but aims to present an interface at
least as high-level as its native C++ binding, while making use of
Rust's features.
